<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_1</i> How can I extract my savefile to use with DoujinSoft?</h5>
For DIY Showcase savefiles, it's as easy as copying the save to a SD Card. The data.bin file you will find is compatible with our service. 
Dolphin saves also work. <br/>

For NDS savefiles, consider moving your content to a flashcart, and then using its .sav file.

<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_2</i> Can I send you .mio files to add to the archive?</h5>
Send us the .mio files, and we'll add them if they're interesting enough. (Please no remixed stock microgames, we have too many of those already.) <br/>
You can also use our <a href="https://github.com/Difegue/DoujinSoft">source code</a> to roll out your own DIY archive. The more the merrier!

<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_3</i> How can I extract .mio files from my save?</h5> 
Use one of the various <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/?page=utilities&game=1986">save editors</a> available for DIY.

<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_4</i> Some of your japanese (games/records/comics) have a lot of question marks in their names...</h5>
Our name parsing is pretty bad with those magical kanji rune things. <br/>We also have trouble with some of the more esoteric symbols available in DIY, such as üîü, ‚û°Ô∏è, ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, etc. <br/>The names themselves will hovewer be perfectly fine once reinserted into a game save.

<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_5</i> Some of the (games/records/comics) I made back in 2010 are on this archive and it's hella embarassing! <br/>Can you do something?</h5>
If you want a creation removed, email us. It'd be a darn shame though :^(

<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_6</i> What's your stance on the "risque" games that were made with DIY?</h5>
While we removed the more hardcore stuff from the archive, we globally don't care that much. The crazy jap hentai games <b>are</b> a part of the experience, after all.

<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_7</i> What's the Major Feature(tm)?</h5>
Integration with RiiConnect24! Coming soon.

<h5 class="white-text"> <i class="material-icons">filter_8</i> Where did you source the games from?</h5>
The Nintendo WFC dump can be found <a href="https://archive.org/details/WarioWareDIYWarehouse">here.</a>
    Other games from the theme contests and NinSoft can be found in <a href="http://vixynya.blog6.fc2.com/">this collection.</a>
