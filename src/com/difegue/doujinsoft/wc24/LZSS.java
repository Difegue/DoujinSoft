/**
 * The LZSS compression is a port of code as implemented for STEP. The following
 * information gives the history of this implementation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Compression Info, 10-11-95<br>
 * Jeff Wheeler
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2><u>Source of Algorithm</u></h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The compression algorithms used here are based upon the algorithms developed
 * and published by Haruhiko Okumura in a paper entitled
 * "Data Compression Algorithms of LARC and LHarc." This paper discusses three
 * compression algorithms, LSZZ, LZARI, and LZHUF. LZSS is described as the
 * "first" of these, and is described as providing moderate compression with
 * good speed. LZARI is described as an improved LZSS, a combination of the LZSS
 * algorithm with adaptive arithmetic compression. It is described as being
 * slower than LZSS but with better compression. LZHUF (the basis of the common
 * LHA compression program) was included in the paper, however, a free usage
 * license was not included.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following are copies of the statements included at the beginning of each
 * source code listing that was supplied in the working paper.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <blockquote>LZSS, dated 4/6/89, marked as "Use, distribute and modify this
 * program freely."</blockquote>
 * 
 * <blockquote>LZARI, dated 4/7/89, marked as "Use, distribute and modify this
 * program freely."</blockquote>
 * 
 * <blockquote>LZHUF, dated 11/20/88, written by Haruyasu Yoshizaki, translated
 * by Haruhiko Okumura on 4/7/89. Not expressly marked as redistributable or
 * modifiable.</blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since both LZSS and LZARI are marked as "use, distribute and modify freely"
 * we have felt at liberty basing our compression algorithm on either of these.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2><u>Selection of Algorithm</u></h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Working samples of three possible compression algorithms are supplied in
 * Okumura's paper. Which should be used?
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * LZSS is the fastest at decompression, but does not generated as small a
 * compressed file as the other methods. The other two methods provided,
 * perhaps, a 15% improvement in compression. Or, put another way, on a 100K
 * file, LZSS might compress it to 50K while the others might approach 40-45K.
 * For STEP purposes, it was decided that decoding speed was of more importance
 * than tighter compression. For these reasons, the first compression algorithm
 * implemented is the LZSS algorithm.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2><u>About LZSS Encoding</u></h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * (adapted from Haruhiko Okumura's paper)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This scheme was proposed by Ziv and Lempel [1]. A slightly modified version
 * is described by Storer and Szymanski [2]. An implementation using a binary
 * tree has been proposed by Bell [3].
 * </p>
 * 
 * The algorithm is quite simple.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Keep a ring buffer which initially contains all space characters.</li>
 * <li>Read several letters from the file to the buffer.</li>
 * <li>Search the buffer for the longest string that matches the letters just
 * read, and send its length and position into the buffer.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the ring buffer is 4096 bytes, the position can be stored in 12 bits. If
 * the length is represented in 4 bits, the &lt;position, length&gt; pair is two bytes
 * long. If the longest match is no more than two characters, then just one
 * character is sent without encoding. The process starts again with the next
 * character. An extra bit is sent each time to tell the decoder whether the
 * next item is a character of a &lt;position, length&gt; pair.
 * </p>
